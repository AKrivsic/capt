  Caption:
    "Write 2-3 Instagram caption variants (1-3 short lines each). Return each variant on a separate line. Each MUST have different opening words. Include at least 1 in-game detail (ping spike, desync, Dust2, whiff, netcode). Allowed micro-CTAs: 'Save if relatable', 'Comment your L', 'Tag your duo'. BAN: 'follow for more', 'swipe up', hashtags in caption. Max 2 emoji per line. Profanity softened (f**k, WTH).",
  Bio:
    "Write exactly 3 single-line Instagram bio variants (â‰¤90 chars each). Return each variant on a separate line. Each MUST be distinct: (1) Identity/role, (2) Value prop, (3) Mood/style. Use 0-2 emoji max per variant. BAN: questions to audience, direct CTAs, violent imagery. Keep brand-safe, memorable, commercially viable.",
  Hashtags:
    "Return ONLY 18-28 Instagram hashtags as a SINGLE space-separated line. Mix: 60-70% general gaming/FPS + 3-5 niche FPS tags (matchmaking, netcode, spraycontrol, aimtrain, headshot). Use lowercase for generic tags; keep acronyms/brands as-is (e.g., #CS2). BAN: stopwords, filler tags like #gameon, #justforfun. No surrounding text.",
  Comments:
    "Write 5 short, unique Instagram comments users might post. One per line. Return only the 5 lines. Include 1-2 comments with in-game lexicon (ping, whiff, clutch, desync). BAN phrases: 'Obsessed', 'So clean', 'Serving looks', 'Chef's kiss', 'Iconic'. Profanity softened (WTH not wtf).",
  Story:
    "Write a 2-3 slide Instagram story script. One sentence per line, no 'Slide 1:' prefixes. At least 1 slide must reference the vibe/topic. Include at least 1 in-game element (ping/desync/Dust2/whiff). End last slide with subtle IG micro-CTA: 'comment your L ðŸ‘‡', 'save for later', 'tag your duo'. BAN: 'Swipe up', 'Tap for the reveal', 'Behind the magic', 'Instant save', follow-CTAs. Max 2 emoji per slide."

  Caption:
    "Write a social caption (1â€“3 short lines). Include fitting emojis if natural. Return only the caption, no quotes. Each variant MUST be meaningfully different in tone/wording/structure and MUST use a different opening. Prefer concise, in-community specifics over clichÃ©s. Follow current platform guidance.",
  Bio:
    "Write exactly 3 single-line bio variants (â‰¤90 chars each). Return each variant on a separate line. Each MUST be distinct: (1) Identity/role (who I am), (2) Value prop (what I deliver), (3) Mood/style (subtle style signature). Use 0-2 emoji max per variant (Glamour/Innocent prefer 0). Optional micro-hints like 'clips daily'/'highlights daily'. BAN: vulgarity, questions to audience, aggressive CTAs, violent imagery (crime scene, bloodbath, killfeed). Tone: no questions/directive CTAs. Keep brand-safe, memorable, commercially viable.",
  Hashtags:
    "Return ONLY 18â€“28 relevant hashtags as a SINGLE space-separated line. Mix broad tags with niche/trending ones. Never split hashtags into individual words (#THIS #IS #NOT...). No filler or stopwords. All hashtags must be a single token starting with #. Use lowercase for generic tags and keep acronyms/brand/proper names as is. Prefer topic/context tags; avoid unrelated pop-culture tags. Each variant MUST use a different set or mix of tags.",
  DM:
    "Write a short, friendly DM opener (2â€“4 lines). Return only if requested in outputs. Keep it personal and conversational. Each variant MUST use a different opening angle (sympathy, joke, invite to chat, playful banter).",
  Comments:
    "Write 5 short, natural comments users might post. One per line. Return only the 5 lines. All 5 lines MUST be unique and tied to the topic/vibe. Include slang/emojis/memes if natural. Avoid generic beauty compliments. BAN phrases: 'Obsessed', 'So clean', 'Serving looks', 'Chef's kiss', 'Iconic'. Follow platform tone.",
  Story:
    "Write a 2-3 slide story script. One sentence per line, no 'Slide 1:' prefixes. At least 1 slide must reference the vibe/topic. Style adaptation: Rage/Edgy (max 1 ALL-CAPS sentence total, short punches), Glamour/Innocent (no caps lock, no aggressive emoji, elegant/gentle), Meme/Funny (1 meme twist/ironic bracket/wordplay max), Streamer (can reference moments like '0:13 clutch', decent CTA). End last slide with subtle punchline/micro-CTA tied to the story (e.g., 'queue therapy at 8?', 'patch notes when?', 'saving this run for later'). BAN: 'Behind the magic', 'Tap for the reveal', 'Swipe up for more', 'Instant save', 'Serving looks'. Max 2 emoji per slide (Glamour/Innocent prefer 0-1).",
  Hook:
    "Write 5 scroll-stopping hooks. One per line. Return only the 5 lines. All 5 hooks MUST be unique and platform-appropriate."
