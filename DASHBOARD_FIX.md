# Dashboard Redirect Fix

## Problem

After logging in, clicking the Dashboard button redirects back to the login page instead of going to the dashboard. The error logs show:

```
Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: "42P05", message: "prepared statement \"s0\" already exists", severity: "ERROR", detail: None, column: None, hint: None }), transient: false })
```

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by Prisma prepared statement conflicts in serverless environments, particularly when using connection poolers like PgBouncer.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Prisma Configuration

- Added explicit datasource configuration in `src/lib/prisma.ts`
- Added `directUrl` to Prisma schema for proper connection handling

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added try-catch blocks in session functions to prevent crashes
- Improved dashboard layout to handle session errors gracefully

### 3. Environment Variables Setup

You need to set up these environment variables:

```bash
# For connection pooling (recommended for production)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"

# Direct connection for migrations (without pooling)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
```

### 4. Key Changes Made

#### `src/lib/prisma.ts`

- Added explicit datasource configuration
- Removed unnecessary eslint-disable comment

#### `src/lib/session.ts`

- Added error handling to prevent session crashes
- Made functions more resilient to database errors

#### `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

- Improved session validation logic
- Better error handling for authentication

#### `prisma/schema.prisma`

- Added `directUrl` configuration for proper connection handling

## Next Steps

1. **Update your environment variables** with the proper DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL
2. **Restart your application** to apply the changes
3. **Test the dashboard access** after logging in

## Additional Recommendations

- If using Supabase or similar services, ensure you're using the correct connection strings
- Consider restarting your database server if the issue persists
- Monitor the logs for any remaining prepared statement conflicts

The fix addresses both the Prisma connection issues and the authentication flow problems that were causing the redirect loop.
