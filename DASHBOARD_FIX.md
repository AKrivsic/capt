# Dashboard Redirect Fix

## Problem

After logging in, clicking the Dashboard button redirects back to the login page instead of going to the dashboard. The error logs show:

```
Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { code: "42P05", message: "prepared statement \"s0\" already exists", severity: "ERROR", detail: None, column: None, hint: None }), transient: false })
```

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by Prisma prepared statement conflicts in serverless environments, particularly when using connection poolers like PgBouncer.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Prisma Configuration

- Added connection pooling parameters to prevent prepared statement conflicts
- Implemented robust Prisma client creation with proper URL handling
- Added `directUrl` to Prisma schema for proper connection handling

### 2. Advanced Retry Logic

- Implemented retry mechanism for all database operations
- Added specific handling for prepared statement errors (code 42P05)
- Created fallback mechanisms when retries fail

### 3. NextAuth Adapter Improvements

- Overrode `getSessionAndUser` method with retry logic
- Added direct database fallback when NextAuth adapter fails
- Enhanced session callback with retry mechanism

### 4. Environment Variables Setup

You need to set up these environment variables:

```bash
# For connection pooling (recommended for production)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"

# Direct connection for migrations (without pooling)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
```

### 5. Key Changes Made

#### `src/lib/prisma.ts`

- Added connection pooling parameters (`connection_limit=1`, `pool_timeout=20`, `pgbouncer=true`)
- Implemented robust URL handling for database connections
- Enhanced Prisma client configuration

#### `src/lib/auth.ts`

- Added retry function with exponential backoff
- Overrode NextAuth adapter methods with retry logic
- Implemented fallback mechanism for session retrieval
- Enhanced session callback with retry mechanism

#### `src/lib/session.ts`

- Added retry logic to all session operations
- Implemented specific handling for prepared statement errors
- Made functions more resilient to database errors

#### `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

- Improved session validation logic
- Better error handling for authentication

#### `prisma/schema.prisma`

- Added `directUrl` configuration for proper connection handling

## Next Steps

1. **Update your environment variables** with the proper DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL
2. **Restart your application** to apply the changes
3. **Test the dashboard access** after logging in

## Additional Recommendations

- If using Supabase or similar services, ensure you're using the correct connection strings
- Consider restarting your database server if the issue persists
- Monitor the logs for any remaining prepared statement conflicts

The fix addresses both the Prisma connection issues and the authentication flow problems that were causing the redirect loop.
